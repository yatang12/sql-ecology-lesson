Software Carpentry SQL Cheat Sheet
==================================

Basic Queries
-------------

Select one or more columns of data from a table:

``` sql
SELECT column_name_1, column_name_2 FROM table_name;
```

Select all of the columns in a table:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

Get only unique lines in a query:

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
```

Perform calculations in a query:

``` sql
SELECT column_name_1, ROUND(column_name_2 / 1000.0) FROM table_name;
```

Filtering
---------

Select only the data meeting certain criteria:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'Hello World';
```

Combine conditions:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE (column_name_1 >= 1000) AND (column_name_2 = 'A' OR column_name_2 = 'B');
```

Sorting
-------

Sort results using `ASC` for ascending order or `DESC` for descending
order:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name_1 ASC, column_name_2 DESC;
```

Missing Data
------------

Use `NULL` to represent missing data.

`NULL` is neither true nor false. Operations involving `NULL` produce
`NULL`, e.g., `1+NULL`, `2>NULL`, and `3=NULL` are all `NULL`.

Test whether a value is null:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
```

Test whether a value is not null:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```

Grouping and Aggregation
------------------------

Combine data into groups and calculate combined values in groups:

``` sql
SELECT column_name_1, SUM(column_name_2), COUNT(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name_1;
```

Joins
-----

Join data from two tables:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM table_name_1 JOIN table_name_2 ON table_name_1.column_name = table_name_2.column_name;
```

Combining Commands
------------------

SQL commands must be combined in the following order: `SELECT`, `FROM`,
`JOIN`, `ON`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`.

Creating Tables
---------------

Create tables by specifying column names and types. Include primary and
foreign key relationships and other constraints.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE survey(
        taken   INTEGER NOT NULL,
        person  TEXT,
        quant   REAL NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY(taken, quant),
        FOREIGN KEY(person) REFERENCES person(ident)
);
```

Transactions
------------

Put multiple queries in a transaction to ensure they are ACID (atomic,
consistent, isolated, and durable):

``` sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    DELETE FROM table_name_1 WHERE condition;
    INSERT INTO table_name_2 values(...);
END TRANSACTION;
```

Programming
-----------

Execute queries in a general-purpose programming language by:

- loading the appropriate library
- creating a connection
- creating a cursor
- repeatedly:
  - execute a query
  - fetch some or all results
- disposing of the cursor
- closing the connection

Python example:

``` python
import sqlite3
connection = sqlite3.connect("database_name")
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("...query...")
for r in cursor.fetchall():
    ...process result r...
cursor.close()
connection.close()
```
